    <div class="first" ><p>This home was built in 2016 and was bought within the year. 
    The previous owners of the home moved out about six months ago and the house has been looking for a new occupant since. 
    The pool was not built at the same time as the house but was added to it in 2018. 
    The house has three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms so when the previous owners realized they were having their fifth child, they decided to move to a bigger house.</p></div>

    <p>This two-story house invites its occupants to play outside in the pool during the warm summers of California. 
    Staying inside during inclement weather is just as pleasant with the home's open space and great lighting. 
    The high school and the local shopping center are both within ten miles of the house, making for short and easy commutes. 
    Don't regret missing out on this awesome home; arrange a showing before it's too late!</p>
